HELP:

To save (or PUSH) your local copy of the project onto the repository, issue this command:

	git push git@github.com:myFarmDB/myFarmDB.git master

If you want to make it simpler, you can set up a shortcut so you don't have to type the address in every time. You do that like this:

	git remote add origin git@github.com:myFarmDB/myFarmDB.git

At which point you simply run this to save your copy to the repository:
	
	git push origin master

If you want to download the version of the project from the repository and merge it with one you currently have, run this command:
	
	git pull git@github.com:myFarmDB/myFarmDB.git

If you want to get a totally fresh copy, go to an empty directory, and issue this command:

	git fetch git@github.com:myFarmDB/myFarmDB.git myFarmDB
