HELP:

To save (or PUSH) your local copy of the project onto the repository, issue this command:

	git push git@github.com:myFarmDB/myFarmDB.git master

If you want to make it simpler, you can set up a shortcut so you don't have to type the address in every time. You do that like this:

	git remote add origin git@github.com:myFarmDB/myFarmDB.git

At which point you simply run this to save your copy to the repository:
	
	git push origin master

If you want to download the version of the project from the repository and merge it with one you currently have, run this command:
	
	git pull git@github.com:myFarmDB/myFarmDB.git

If you want to get a totally fresh copy, go to an empty directory, and issue these commands:

	git init
	git remote add online ssh://git@github.com/myFarmDB/myFarmDB.git
	git fetch online

	And you will have to run this:

	git branch -r

	to find out what branch you want to use. It will most probably be the one that makes sense (online/master) So you then run this:

	git checkout online/master

	and there you go!
